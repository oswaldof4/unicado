# **Unicado** seeks to convert a starved marine *pest* into a refined *delicacy* by feeding purple urchins agricultural by-product.

**Environmental Problem**

California's purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) has exploded in population size by 10,000% overtaking native kelp habitat. The purple sea urchin can survive with minimal food and remove the kelp habitat of their predators, so they ultimately form urchin barrens that comprise of thousands of empty individuals.  

**Eco-Entrepreneurship Solution**

These urchin barrens need to be culled in order to allow for the restoration of native kelp habitat. There is a unique environmental opportunity present in incentivizing the consumption of a purple urchins. Feeding these urchins avocado by-product will make use of an agricultural food waste stream that will enhance the quality of pruple sea urchin uni,
